Welcome to Prox2! I can help you submit confessions anonymously!

To get started, open a DM with Prox2 (or yourself.) Then, start typing your confession with

/prox2 <confession>

It's as simple as that!

You can reply to an existing confession using the "Reply anonymously" message shortcut, or react to a message in the thread using the "React anonymously" shortcut!

When a confession of yours gets published, I recommend you "follow thread" on it, so that you will be notified if someone replies in its thread.
Prox2 can't do this automatically since it really doesn't know who published the confession.

Prox2 will be open source forever at https://github.com/anirudhb/prox2!
